# hello-word
my first repository, let's see where it goes and what happens

I've just graduate at mechanical engineering and used to work ina car industry as process simulation intern.


It was a great experince, not just for having the chance to work with process, but also I've learned italian (avevo bisogno di parlare con i miei coleghi italiani per capire meglio cosa loro hanno fatto. Furono buoni momenti di apprendimento).

I also speak a little bit of russian, but it was because of a rocket design project that some friends and I have started.
